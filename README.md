Isn't CMOS logic just the coolest? Yes, I know, it's hardly the 80s to work with discrete logic. But it's fun. Solder, the programming language. The schematic is work in progress and so is the physical board. Once that's finished I'll export a pdf schematic and do the layout for through-hole components. All hobbyist friendly here. At the moment it's a perfboard, which is being flooded by a Lovecraft-esque unicolour tangled mess. Growing steadily.
